## About

This project was made in order to practice GitHub branches as well as general HTML and CSS techniques. For this project I wanted to create a goofy website for my favorite burger place in Portland! Stylistically, I was going for sort of a "what would this sound like if it was read out loud in an 80's action movie voice." I'm sure that'll translate just fine.
