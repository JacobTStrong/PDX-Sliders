    <h2>Why a food cart? We're glad you asked.</h2>
    <p>You've come to know and love eating our burgers at our Sellwood and Division Locations. In fact, you've loved our sliders so much that they have been voted the best in the city. As a thank you, we're hitting the streets to give the people what they want, where they want it. You're welcome. </p>
